            <h3>Criminal Law</h3>
            <p>
                Our approach to criminal defense draws on our experience and
                knowledge. We always strive for efficiency and transparency. Our
                clients will always feel heard, and we will always advise clients on
                approaches that are in their best interest. It is our philosophy to
                never take any approach just because it will make us the most money.
                When we feel that it would be in our client's best interests not to
                use our services, we are always transparent and honest. Clients
                charged for committing any offense will feel safe to talk openly and
                fearlessly about their situation and about the facts that landed
                them being prosecuted for a crime... whether they are guilty or
                innocent. We can help clients see the bigger picture when their
                knowledge might be limited or their vision might be clouded by the
                emotionality of the undoubtedly terrible situation they find
                themselves in. Clients will benefit from our extensive experience in
                this field to help find the best approach and strategy to suit their
                case.

            <h3>Deceased Estates</h3>
            <p>
                Our secret to winding up deceased estates is that we take more than
                an administrative role. We guide those left behind after the passing
                of a loved one through the difficult time. We strive to make the
                administrative process as easy as possible allowing clients time and
                ease of mind to grieve without having to worry about the
                administration of their loved ones estate. We have helped hundreds
                of clients to successfully and efficiently administer estates of all
                sizes, and there is no estate too complex to be finalised time
                effectively and cost-effectively, leaving clients and their families
                with as much of their inheritance as possible.

                of paper listing what must happen to your assets, but we provide
                tangible and practical estate planning services, which can range
                from living wills to living LnD's, trust planning, and registration.

            <p>
                Before being admitted as an attorney, Mr. van der Merwe served his
                article training in a family law firm. After being admitted he
                continued advancing his knowledge and experience in various matters
                relating to family disputes. Divorce litigation can be extremely
                expensive and timeous, but we pride ourselves on resolving divorces
                without leaving both spouses bankrupt. Domestic violence is a
                serious and very prevalent reality in this country. Luckily, we have
                years of experience in assisting vulnerable people in obtaining the
                protection they require when they need it, and clients should always
                feel safe and welcome to obtain the court's protection with as much
                accessibility and ease as possible.

            <p>
                We have successfully mediated and arbitrated all sorts of labour

                behalf. We have helped clients win more than a million Rands in
                compensation.
